    // This is just a silly test to play around with the best way to deal with Decodable types in

    // The fact is that I don't want production code to be able to `init` a `Decodable` type using
    // the compiler provide initializer, because this kind of types should only come from the
    // network. (This is a rule worth questioning, though. Does it really matter? What difference
    // does it make if you can or cannot init those types directly? From the design point of view,
    // does it make sense to define `Decodable` as part of the type definition instead than an
    // extension?)
    //
    // Update: I was surprised that the tests passed immediately, or rather that the code compiled.
    // I'm guessing something has changed in the Swift compiler since I last did this kind of
    // things.

    // would you choose?

    // and also makes it clear that what we're using is an initializer that uses default values.
